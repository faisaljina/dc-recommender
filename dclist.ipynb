    "DataCamp is a great website for learning skills for data science. They have a lot of courses, mostly in R and Python, around all kinds of DS techniques, everything from manipulating time series data, to data viz courses, to different kinds of machine learning etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The courses are laid out in 'tracks', which group courses together under a more general topic. These can be 'Skill Tracks' or 'Career Tracks', and you can select any one track on the DC website to guide your learning. A side effect of this grouping is that some courses appear in multiple tracks. On completion of a track, you get a certificate, which can not only be shared on LinkedIn, but also makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside...\n",
    "\n",
    "Ahem.. \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue I have identified is exemplified by DataCamp's 'Career Tracks', which are longer than the 'Skill Tracks' and cover a broader range of topics. By following a longer Career Track, due to the overlap with the shorter Skill Tracks, en route you may inadvertently complete the requisite material for multiple Skill Tracks (or be very close!). However, by not being enrolled on those Skill Tracks, you have no idea this is the case, and so you don't get those flashy DC certificate along the way despite you having done the required work - outrageous!\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is clear: work out a way of recommending courses based on how close they get you to finishing a track, so that you can rack up those treasured Track certificates as you learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender should include some key ideas, such as:\n",
    "- Course length (some courses are longer than others)\n",
    "- How many tracks a course appears in (if it appears in more tracks, it brings you closer to multiple certificates)\n",
    "- Some measure of how close a course gets you to completing a track (the closer, the better!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst DataCamp doesn't provide the above information directly, it is possible to infer by going through the various course pages on the website. It is also important to say that some tracks are organised into a logical progession of knowledge, which is particularly important with the more fundamental courses - any recommendation of a particular course may simply direct you to the appropriate track to follow in the original order."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "The DataCamp website contains over 50 tracks, which each contain multiple courses. It would take a long time to manually collect the data for this, so this should be scraped from the website where possible. All processing of the data should be as automated as possible. It would be great to get to a point where I could simply run a script and get up-to-date recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst the traffic provided by scraping the website course pages is negligible for a company like DC, this should be kept to a minimum whilst testing and coding out of principle. Minimising repeated scraping of the same data will minimise traffic and save me time, so data should be saved / pickled along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional thing to note: I keep all my DC course certificates in a Github repo. This was initially set up as a DC profile duplicate due to some public access issue on the DC website. That issue has since been resolved, so now I just use that repo as certificate storage, and is something that can be scraped to track my DC progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right, enough talking, time to code."
